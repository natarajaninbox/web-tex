    \section*{Question 1}
    A signal given by $x(t) = a_1\sin(\omega t+\phi_1)$ is applied to a stable linear time-invariant system. Suppose the steady state output response of the system is given by $a_2F(\omega_2 t +\phi_2)$. Then which of the following is true about the function $F$? (\textbf{2 marks})
    \begin{itemize}
        \item F is not necessarily 'sine' or 'cosine', but must be periodic with $\omega_1=\omega_2$.
        \item F must be a 'sine' or a 'cosine' function with $a_1=a_2$
        \item F must be a 'sine' function with $\omega_1=\omega_2$ and $\phi_1=\phi_2$
        \item F must be a 'sine' or 'cosine' function with $\omega_1=\omega_2$.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \section*{Question 2}
    A continuous-time system is described by $y(t)=e^{-|x(t)|}$, where $y(t)$ is the output and $x(t)$ is the input. The output signal $y(t)$ is bounded (\textbf{2 marks})
    \begin{itemize}
        \item only when $x(t)$ is bounded.
        \item only when $x(t)$ is non-negative
        \item only for $t \leq 0$ if $x(t)$ is bounded for $t \geq 0$
        \item even when $x(t)$ is non-negative.
    \end{itemize}
